## What is Keet?

> *Keet* specific goal is to offer freedom of [cumbersome frameworks](https://medium.com/dailyjs/the-deepest-reason-why-modern-javascript-frameworks-exist-933b86ebc445), familiar/vanilla code structures and a possible remedy to [*choice paralysis*](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/addy-osmani/2014-January-19).  Generally *Keet* is more flexible, decent render performance, loosely coupled and has shallow learning curve. It's also only 6kb gzip in size.

## Getting Started

To try out Keet is to include it from a CDN or npm.

Create a HTML file:-

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="//cdn.rawgit.com/syarul/keet/master/keet-min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
  </body>
  <script>
    // your codes goes here
  </script>
</html>
```

Or from npm:-

```npm install keet```
